Investigating the Neural Representation of Observed Actions: A Multi-Arrangement Paradigm
This repository contains the code and data for a research project investigating the neural representation of observed actions in a multi-dimensional space. We analyzed neural activity associated with various action categories presented in a dynamic, ecologically valid, and multi-actor video stimulus set. Employing a multi-arrangement paradigm, we investigated how different action classes were represented in the brain, explored the role of dynamic information, and analyzed how actor identity modulates action processing. We also examined the relationship between perceptual similarity and neural representation and potentially uncovered novel action categories or subcategories based on neural and perceptual responses. The project utilized advanced data analysis methods like searchlight-based multiple regression RSA, t-SNE, and k-means clustering, alongside traditional univariate and multivariate analysis approaches. The results contributed to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying action perception and how the Action Perception Network processes various action categories, with potential implications for the development of action recognition-based technologies.
