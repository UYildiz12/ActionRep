<h2>Investigating the Neural Representation of Observed Actions: A Multi-Arrangement Paradigm</h2>
This repository contains the code and data for a research project investigating the neural representation of observed actions in a multi-dimensional space. We analyzed neural activity associated with various action categories presented in a dynamic, ecologically valid, and multi-actor video stimulus set. Employing a multi-arrangement paradigm, we investigated how different action classes were represented in the brain, explored the role of dynamic information, and analyzed how actor identity modulates action processing. We also examined the relationship between perceptual similarity and neural representation, potentially uncovering novel action categories or subcategories based on neural and perceptual responses. Utilizing advanced data analysis methods, including searchlight-based multiple regression RSA, t-SNE, and UMAP, alongside traditional univariate and multivariate analysis approaches, we contributed to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying action perception and how the Action Perception Network processes various action categories. These findings have potential implications for the development of action recognition-based technologies.
